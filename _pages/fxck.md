<figure class="align-right"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2018/03/30/scar-256.jpg" alt="Justin Rummel profile pic" /></figure>A couple of weeks ago I discovered a triathlon team who had a mission other than friendship and fitness.  Don't get me wrong, those are the two main reasons I've been doing triathlons for the past five years and I love my [Speed Sherpa][SS], but after my recent surgery I've become more aware that mine was easy... mine was lucky... and not everyone has those cards dealt to them while living their life.  That is why I have now joined the Fxck Cancer Triathlon Team.

When you join their team, you have also made a commit to raise money that will be donated to the main 501c3 Non Profit Organization by the end of 2018.  Not really sure how to raise money (I'm *not* a sales person), I'll see what I can do utilizing my website and social media outlets to see if anyone becomes inspired.

How do you donate?  Glad you asked! Visit [my donation page][donate], and click on the big white "DONATE" button.  From there; enter the standard info when making charity donations (name, address, credit card) and unfortunately agree to create an account (name, email, password... Facebook has sold more info on you than that).  There are predefined options, or "Other" on the far right hand side.  Anything that you can contribute would be greatly appreciated in hitting my goal.

So who is Fxck Cancer? In their words: 

> Fxck Cancer's Mission: "To fight cancer by raising awareness and to educate about early cancer detection, ultimately putting an end to late stage cancer diagnosis. Through our Dyin 2 Live Dreams program, we look to enrich the lives of those fighting cancer by offering them an experience that will bring hope, joy, inspiration, and courage into their lives. In doing this, the program hopes it can help give the cancer fighter a chance to forget, even if itâ€™s only for a day, what they are battling. We hope it can be used as a source of inspiration to those needing a brighter day in their darkest hour." (www.fxckcancer.org)

Is this Tax Deductible?

> F C Cancer Foundation is a 501c3 nonprofit organization (Tax ID#26-2359885), which fights cancer by raising awareness and educating about early cancer detection and prevention, ultimately putting an end to late stage cancer diagnosis.

Other questions are most likely answered on their [FAQ page][faq].

I'm still being coached by Speed Sherpa, and will still race for Speed Sherpa during my A races... but in-between those events I'll be trying to promote Fxck Cancer team in hopes to make a small contribution to a great cause.
