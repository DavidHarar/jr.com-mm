message: "Hello Doreen,\r\n\r\nIt has been a while since I've worked with DEP and VPP (almost two years now).  When I used to do this for other people, we definitely had a unique ID who's purpose was to do Administration vs. Purchasing vs. a User.  If you are coming from a Business Environment, I would suggest getting to know your local Apple Store's Business representative.  They are they to help answer questions from that perspective vs. the \"general user\".  You may also be reference to an Apple Consultant that the store frequently works with to assist businesses that need guidance in helping to understand how Apple \"thinks\".  ;)\r\n\r\nAs for 2FA, I would guess that is still required as in Apple's eyes this is sensitive information which requires that level of security."
