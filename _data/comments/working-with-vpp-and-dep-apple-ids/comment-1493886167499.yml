message: "Hi Justin, \r\n\r\nthanks for these steps. Do you know if its possible to change the Apple ID for DEP and VPP? We want to use a technical user for this whom can be used by more users than one - is it possible to do this or has it always be a real person? Also the two-step-verification: is it always needed or can I disable it? \r\nFor me its hard to understand how Apple thinks this will work in a Company with a group of administrators for the Business Apple Environment..."
