message: <p>Ha! No that was not my intension... it was the comment of someone not
  liking the name Bushel.  I would state they have not thought of the name as defined
  on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.reference.com%2Fbrowse%2Fbushel%3ABDIdgV8ONdhPeTOUUSNAYLdGPMk&amp;cuid=13645"
  rel="nofollow noopener">dictionary.com</a> "n. large, unspecified amount or number".</p><p>Hence,
  a Bushel of Apples.</p>
