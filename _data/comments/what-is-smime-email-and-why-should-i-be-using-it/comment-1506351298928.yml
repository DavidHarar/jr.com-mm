message: "Hello Justin,\r\n\r\nI hope you are still reading these comments. I stumbled into this page because I'm trying to understand what S/MIME offers over regular SSL/TLS. If you are already sending encrypted email with SSL/TLS, why would you use S/MIME? Doesn't SSL/TLS already ensures authentication, integrity and confidentiality?"
