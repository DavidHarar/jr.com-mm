message: "Since upgrading to mountain lion nfs won't start automatically at boot...
  but i can start it manually. I've configured in etc/exports the nfs mounts to be
  available.\r\n\r\n
  The nfs mounts are in an external disk (Share HD). \r\n\r\n
  I think to do that I've to start NetInstall.\r\n\r\n
  I edit storage settings and indicate
  Share HD to be storage for clients and data. Every time i turn NetInstall on i Get
  the message \"Unable to start Netinstall. To start netinstall, you must have at least
  one image available to acres by clients.\"\r\n\r\n
  Any help\r\n\r\n"
