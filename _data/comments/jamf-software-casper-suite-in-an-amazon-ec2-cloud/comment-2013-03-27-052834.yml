message: <p>Great write up and very informative. Would you mind elaborating more on
  the section I posted below and how you would do it? "You can configure Reposado
  to be your primary index.sucatalog which points to Apppleâ€™s download servers (thus
  not requiring you to store any data)." I have Reposado and Magarita running internally,
  but I would love to have what you are describing.</p>
