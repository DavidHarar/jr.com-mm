  is undefined, only Apple catalogs will be replicated and the URLs will not be re-written.  The
  actual Software Update packages will not be downloaded. This allows you to have
  custom catalogs for Apple Software Update, but clients will still download the actual
  update packages from Apple's servers. If Reposado is configured this way, you will
  not be able to offer deprecated updates to clients."</p>
