message: <p>One thing that may explain the difference is that my test Lion install
  was done cleanly on to a blank disk as opposed to an upgrade over an existing Snow
  Leopard install.Â </p><p>If yours was an upgrade it may explain why you still have
  the controls. I'll have to look into this some more myself. I may have to try an
  upgrade and see what happens.</p>
