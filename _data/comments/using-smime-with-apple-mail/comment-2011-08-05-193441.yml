message: One thing that may explain the difference is that my test Lion install
  was done cleanly on to a blank disk as opposed to an upgrade over an existing Snow
  Leopard install.Â \r\n\r\n
  If yours was an upgrade it may explain why you still have
  the controls. I'll have to look into this some more myself. I may have to try an
  upgrade and see what happens.
