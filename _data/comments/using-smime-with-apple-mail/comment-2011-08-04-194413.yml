message: <p>On my test system, Mail in Mac OS X Lion 10.7 does not show the controls
  to sign/encrypt an email message. I've tried the customize header pull-down menu
  but they are not there either. Of course, everything works perfectly in Snow Leopard
  10.6.x.</p><p>In case it makes a difference, the mail client in Lion (this is the
  released version not a pre-release beta) is version 5.0 (1244.2/1244.3)</p>
