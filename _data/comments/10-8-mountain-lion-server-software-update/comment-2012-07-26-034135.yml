message: I think you can relocate where it stores the updates by manually edit
  the swupd.plist file under Config. the key is "updatesDocRoot", value is a path
  to where you want to store the update files. Make sure the folder you are pointing
  to has a owner and group of "_softwareupdate". I have mine relocated to an external
  drive. Works fine.
