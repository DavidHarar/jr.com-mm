message: <p>This would need to be tested.  It's my experience with Lion (and Mt Lion)
  that when you save a setting using <a href="http://Server.app"
  rel="nofollow noopener">Server.app</a>, it doesn't just change the one value, it
  basically re-writes the entire config file.  So any changes to the updatesDocRoot
  may be put back to default status of /Library/Server/Software\ Updates/</p><p>Just
  a warning... </p>
