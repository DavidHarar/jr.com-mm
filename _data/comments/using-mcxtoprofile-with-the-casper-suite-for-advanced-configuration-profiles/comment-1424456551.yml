message: "Thanks Greg! Always appreciate getting comments from you.\r\n\r\nI was surprised when changing  Menu Items manually that com.apple.mcxMenuExtras was not being utilized as I remember that file from using Workgroup Manager. With that file not being created, I had concerns about future proofing this article.  With that said, I may also not be backwards compatible with older OSs.  People will have to test and verify, but my primary goal was to get Casper Admins acquainted with mcxToProfile for more options outside of the default API presentation that JAMF provides in the JSS."
