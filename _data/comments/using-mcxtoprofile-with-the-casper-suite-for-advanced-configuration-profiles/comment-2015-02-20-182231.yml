message: <p>Thanks Greg! Always appreciate getting comments from you.</p><p>I was
  surprised when changing  Menu Items manually that com.apple.mcxMenuExtras was not
  being utilized as I remember that file from using Workgroup Manager. With that file
  not being created, I had concerns about future proofing this article.  With that
  said, I may also not be backwards compatible with older OSs.  People will have to
  test and verify, but my primary goal was to get Casper Admins acquainted with mcxToProfile
  for more options outside of the default API presentation that JAMF provides in the
  JSS.</p>
