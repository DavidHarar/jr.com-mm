  again.  Doing some more googling I found http://blog.anupamsg.me/2012/02/14/enabling-postfix-for-outbound-relay-via-gmail-on-os-x-lion-11/
   and noticed one line
  was missing in my mods:</p><p>smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain</p><p>since adding
  this line I can now send mail from my server via these test commands:</p><p>telnet
  localhost 25<br />MAIL FROM: email@domain.tld<br />RCPT TO: email@domain.tld<br

  is important)</p>'
