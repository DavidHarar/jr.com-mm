  [http://blog.anupamsg.me/2012/02/14/enabling-postfix-for-outbound-relay-via-gmail-on-os-x-lion-11/](http://blog.anupamsg.me/2012/02/14/enabling-postfix-for-outbound-relay-via-gmail-on-os-x-lion-11/)
  and noticed one line was missing in my mods:\r\n\r\n

  ``` bash\r\n
  smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain\r\n
  ```

  since adding this line I can now send mail from my server via these test commands:\r\n\r\n

  ``` bash\r\n
  telnet\r\n
  localhost 25\r\n
  MAIL FROM: email@domain.tld\r\n
  RCPT TO: email@domain.tld\r\n
  DATA\r\n
  This is a test message.  #1\r\n
  .\r\n
  ```

  (the period on the last line is important)"
