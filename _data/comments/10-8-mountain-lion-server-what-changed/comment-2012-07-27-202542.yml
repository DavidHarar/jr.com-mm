message: <p>Ha! Don't take my quick opinion on Xsan to seriously. I don't manage an
  Xsan environment and have only installed a new Xsan once two years ago. The lack
  of Xsan doesn't personally effect me.  I did appreciate the severcie when I was
  installing Podcast Producer in 10.6 in several schools. </p>
