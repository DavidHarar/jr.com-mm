message: <p>Justin,</p><p>I realize the need for a firewall.  Does IceFloor work for
  what you want it to do?  I only ask because that's what I use.  I just don't know
  if you considered it, or if a packet filter firewall will work for what you want
  to use it for.  I like that I can use it to lock traffic down to my LAN (I do this
  for my client computers), and the fact that it is a front end for the built in firewall
  (built in to ML).</p>
