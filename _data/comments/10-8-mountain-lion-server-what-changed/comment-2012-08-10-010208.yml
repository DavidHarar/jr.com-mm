message: <p>I'm just now setting up a Mountain Lion server in our new Alexandria location,
  and I was a little shocked to find the Firewall service missing. I also downloaded
  IceFloor, but I feel like I'm going to have to spend a week (I don't have) to tweak
  this just right in order to make it run like the old Firewall service did.</p><p>Any
  thoughts on why Apple removed this? More and more, I feel like they're winding down
  Server. </p>
