message: "Hello!  Unfortunately the wiki themes of 10.6 are not carried over when
  upgrading to 10.7 and 10.8 as noted in Apple's kbase article:
  [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202538](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202538)\r\n\r\n
  You'll need to expand the \"Upgrading from Lion Server or Mac OS X Server v10.6 Snow Leopard\"
  link and scroll all the way to the bottom to find this line for \"Wiki\"."
