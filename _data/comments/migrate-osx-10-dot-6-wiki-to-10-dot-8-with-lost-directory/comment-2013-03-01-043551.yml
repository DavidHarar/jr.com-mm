message: <p>Earlier OS X Servers had a different, mobile, version of the wiki when
  connecting from an iPhone. Now I'm just presented with the standard interface, really
  really small.  Is there a way to get the old behavior back, even if just as an option,
  or did apple do away with it? For most content it used to reformat the text really
  well for the smaller screens. And Navigation was also much better.</p>
