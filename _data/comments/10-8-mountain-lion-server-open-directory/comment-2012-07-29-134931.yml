  rel="nofollow noopener">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS...</a> for common ports.</p><p>You
  would want to start with 311 and 660. But you may want others open as well such
  as ARD to control, ssh, or look at Profile Manager thus need APNS.</p><p>To set
  up remotely, I would say get a VPN setup or get someone to start TeamViewer session.  Less
  hassle than figuring out ports. :)</p>
