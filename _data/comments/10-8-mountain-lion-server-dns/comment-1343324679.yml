  One question I have is that do you see Server app giving you \"The host name has changed\"
  alert every time you reboot the machine? This only start to happen when DNS is enabled.
  In its detailed message it says \"The host name of this server has changed from sever to
  server.home.private. Some services may not work properly bla bla...\".\r\n

  Nothing I have tried have worked. I have this issue from a fresh install."
