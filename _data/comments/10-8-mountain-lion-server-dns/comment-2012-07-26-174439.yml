message: <p>Great guide, thanks!</p><p>One question I have is that do you see Server
  app giving you "The host name has changed" alert every time you reboot the machine?
  This only start to happen when DNS is enabled. In its detailed message it says "The
  host name of this server has changed from sever to server.home.private. Some services
  may not work properly bla bla...".<br />Nothing I have tried have worked. I have
  this issue from a fresh install. </p>
