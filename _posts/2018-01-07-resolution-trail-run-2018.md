Short Race report, as I was able to participate in Adventure Enablers' Resolution Run for the second year in a row.  The original goal was to run with the family like last year[^1], so I wasn't thinking about actually "racing"... but more as a motivator for the younger two as they were going to attempt the 5k vs. the 1mile fun run. 

When the family bailed because of being too cold, was sick, or simply slept in[^2]... I decided to use this 5k as a fitness self assessment compared to one year ago.  I had a great time connecting with fellow teammate and <a href="{{ site.url }}/ironman-louisville-2017-race-report/">Ironman Louisville</a> finisher Patricia!  We both won our age groups, so it was a happy walk back to the cars.
