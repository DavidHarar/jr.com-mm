For the past few months during the triathlon off-season, I've been drawn to running and biking outdoors in trails around the area to just "have fun".  I knew I needed a break from racing and simply enjoying being outside, and the time I've spent since the purchase of my new [2016 Scott Scale 930 Mountain Bike][930] has made me feel like a kid again as if I was riding through the neighborhood "dirt trails" exploring new areas that have yet been charted (at least before they were destroyed for new home development).  It seems to me I have a new calling to be out in the woods, so you are going to see a lot more of trail Ride / Run (Xterra) posts for 2017.

But today... it's New Years Day!  What better way to spend the time than with a little run in the woods with friends and family.  Somehow I was able to convince the entire family to join me out in the woods to participate in ~~Rev 3 Adventure~~ [Adventure Enablers][AE] - [2017 Resolution Trail Run][RR].  There were three distance options to choose from: 10k, 5k, and 1-Mile Fun Run.  The whole family had a blast.  I wish I could have seen Colleen and the boys take off for their 1-Mile run as the photographs tell the story their group had the best time.

I've ridden [Conway Robinson State Forest Park][CRSP] a couple of times on my mountain bike, so I was familiar with the trail and knew where it would be technical for foot placement along where some slick wet/mud areas would show up.  I was doing well until the 2.5 mile mark where there is a continuous uphill climb that caught me by surprise, thus I didn't adjust my stride like I should have and peaked really high on my heart rate at 186 bpm.

Hopefully throughout the year I'll be able to convince them to join me in other outdoor "adventures".
