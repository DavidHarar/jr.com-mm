Just one more step closer to getting ready for my long race this October, but has boosted my confidence that I may actually complete the race and not fall over from physical exhaustion.

Anyone in the Northern Virginia area who is looking to achieve a long ride (32, 69, or 100 miles) I would highly recommend looking into [Reston Bike Club][rbc] annual Century ride.  The support crew was AMAZING as we had a guided route that included a rest stop every 20 miles (on average) so you could refill bottles, grab snacks, or complete a bio break.  [Printed and GPS][maps] cue sheets were also available which was GREATLY appreciated (and worked flawlessly on my Wahoo ELEMNT BOLT).

As for the ride, I was able to see different parts of Virginia that I haven't seen before on my usual routes.  I was also able to see the infamous "[Taylorstown][taylor]" hill which is on average 5% incline over 1.6 miles, however, at some spots the incline is really steep at +10%.  That hill was then followed by another called "[Stumptown][stump]" which was another 1.6 mile ascent with an average of 3% incline, but peaked at 12%!  Doing this on a Triathlon bike, which usually doesn't have the larger gears on the rear cassette, makes both of these hills a grueling endeavor.
