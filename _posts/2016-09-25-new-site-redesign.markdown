Over the past week I've been fighting an infection that was draining all of my energy, rendering me incapable of working out[^1].  This left me with some extra time on my hands to address the fact that this site design has become boring to me and drastically needed a makeover!  While reviewing different templates for the [Jekyll][jekyll] static site generator, I eventually returned to the awesome page designer [Michael Rose][mmistakes] for his new [Minimal Mistakes][mm] Theme.

Migrating my articles from the old template to the new template was completed in a couple of hours, but then the <strike>obsessive compulsive</strike> detailed oriented aspects of a site redesign became overwhelming and took a couple more nights to complete the final touches that would make it worthy for viewing by the two people that actually look at this site[^2].  Everything functions as expected, but there still may be some formatting issues on a couple of articles that need to be corrected, in addition some article YAML changes to ensure that tags and categories are working.

I know this is not really interesting, but hopefully the site change will inspire some new content outside of race reports.
